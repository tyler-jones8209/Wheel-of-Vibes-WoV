        <strong>WHAT</strong><br>
        Wheel of Vibes (super creative name I know) is a project that I've wanted to create for ages. It's the perfect combination of what I love most: music, languages, and programming.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>HOW</strong><br>
        I used basic HTML, CSS, and Javascript to create the foundation of the website, and then incorporate Spotify (sorry if you don't use Spotify) playlists. My GitHub page for this project can be found <a href="https://github.com/tyler-jones8209/Wheel-of-Vibes-WoV/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file">here</a>. The majority of the music was either music I already knew, music that I found through research, or music shown to me by friends.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</strong><br>

        <br>
        <strong>DISCLAIMER</strong><br>
        I don't speak these languages (aside from some Spanish and Japanese), so if any lyrics contain offensive content, I sincerely apologize.
