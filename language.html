                    <strong>Japanese</strong>, my all-time favorite language 
                    (that I'm <i>totally fluent</i> in), is spoken in Japan. It uses three different scripts: Kanji (漢字), derived from Chinese characters; 
                    Hiragana (ひらがな), used for grammatical elements, native Japanese words, and Kanji pronounciation; Katakana (カタカナ), used for foreign words and names.
                    There are around <strong>128 million speakers</strong> worldwide. 大学で1年間、日本語を勉強した。日本の音楽が大好きだ。

                    <br><br><strong>Some of my favorite songs are:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>YABA (やば。)</strong> - Fujii Kaze (藤井風)</li>
                        <li><strong>MUKANJYO</strong> - Survive Said The Prophet</li>
                        <li><strong>Hakujitsu (白日)</strong> - King Gnu</li>
                        <li><strong>Odoriko (踊り子)</strong> - Vaundy</li>
                        <li><strong>Backlight (逆光)</strong> - Ado</li>
                        <li><strong>Single Focus (単焦点)</strong> - Penthouse</li>
                        <li><strong>FAKE MOON</strong> - DURDN</li>
